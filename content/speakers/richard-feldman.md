Richard is the author of "Elm in Action" from Manning Publications, and the instructor for the Frontend Masters Intro to Elm and Advanced Elm workshops. When he's not writing about Elm, teaching Elm, speaking about Elm, or hosting the Philadelphia Elm meetup, he likes to take a break from his job at NoRedInk (where front-end programmers spend almost almost all their coding time writing production Elm code) by kicking back and working on some of his open-source Elm projects.

Some have said he’s "into Elm," but he’s not sure where they got that wild idea.
