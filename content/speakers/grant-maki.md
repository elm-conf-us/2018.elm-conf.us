## Grant's Talk: *Facilitating Technology Change Through Cultural Change*

When we discuss how to help teams adopt new technologies or paradigms like Elm of Functional Programming, we often focus on a technical glide path. Not enough attention is given to building a team culture that is open to experimenting with new technologies and adopting them if the experiments go well. This talk will explore strategies and tactics to build such a culture through the lens of my team's experiences at Ford Motor Company. Building such a culture has produced a number of pleasant side effects, including allowing our team to adopt Elm for all of our front-end development.
