## Anthony's talk: *Programming Robots with Elm*

Elm is most often used to make webapps, but by using ports and a bit of glue code Elm can be embedded anywhere we can use Javascript. This opens up a lot of possibilities.

In this talk we will use Elm to program a robot. This will involve both imperative and functional programming, and play to the strengths of each of them. We'll also discover how the patterns we use in webapps translate to other domains.
