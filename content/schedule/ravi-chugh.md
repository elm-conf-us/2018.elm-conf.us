Ravi Chugh is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago, where he uses Elm both in teaching and in research. His primary research obsession is to develop new kinds of programming environments and user interfaces that allow people to be more productive and creative. Ravi received an NSF CAREER Award in 2017 to pursue this kind of work, as well as a Neubauer Faculty Fellowship in 2015 for innovative and effective undergraduate teaching.

## Ravi's talk: *Structured Editing for Elm\* in Elm*

We are building a code editor, called Deuce, that adds support for structured editing to a conventional text editor. Deuce supports an Elm-like language and is implemented in Elm.

In this editor, the user can hover over and select expressions and other code items of interest (using direct manipulation). Then, the editor displays a menu of context-sensitive program transformations, such as Introduce Variable, Introduce Function, and Refactor Data Type. We will demonstrate the kinds of interactions enabled by this combination of text- and structured-editing.
