## Dillon's talk: *Types Without Borders*

We love the feeling we get writing Elm code where "if it compiles it works™." But what happens when we need to interact with the outside world from Elm? Our API throws a curve ball and gives us an unexpected null. Or we're not sure what keys an object returned from a javascript library has. So we have to keep tweaking the code and refreshing the page to see if our decoders fail at runtime. Can't we do better than that!?

We can! In this talk you'll learn about 3 packages that enforce contracts with the outside world and give us confidence that things will work the FIRST time we load our app.
